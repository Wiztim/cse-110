## There are some who call me... Tim <sup><sup> or Timothy Orlov if you want to be formal
Hello and welcome to my Github page, where I will attempt to discuss myself as a person and programmer. To start off, here is some info about me:
> Currently a senior Math-CS major

I transferred to UCSD from Las Positas community college as a Math major in 2021. I then quickly adjusted to Math-CS, since it is effectively the same as a CS degree.
> Taking 4 classes this quarter

CSE 101, 110, 130, and math 174. This will supposedly be my hardest quarter at UCSD, but I don't think it will be as bad as all the proof based math courses I took last year. At least I'll only need 1 more upper division math and 3 more upper division CS classes after this.
> Love to play niche games

I spend most of my free time playing games I read about from random parts of the internet. Don't have much else to say about them, as I'd rather talk about them than have this one-sided conversation. Some of these games include:

- Deep Rock Galactic
- Faster than Light
- Space Station 13
- Terraria
- Noita
- Len'en
> Experiencing DDR withdrawal

One of my favorite games is Dance Dance Revolution, and there isn't any easy way to play it here anymore. The nearest arcade right now is in Temecula, so I'd have to plan and dedicate a lot more time for it. I did hear rumors that something close might be opening nearby, so I'm hopeful for that.

## My favorite language is Java... no! C++!
Onto my programming life. I started in middle school, but didn't get serious until high school. Since then, I've either done a class using the following languages or made a project: Java, C++, C#, C, ARM, Python, GO Lang,  and JavaScript. Of the languages, here is the order in which I'd like to use more of: 
1. C++, C#, or GO Lang
2. C or Java
3. Python or JavaScript
4. ARM

I also dabbled with html and a tiny bit of CSS, and learned I don't like frontend development. Here are some of the way I used the languages:
> 3 personal projects

Over the past 2 summers, I created 3 personal projects: [a music player](https://github.com/Wiztim/MusicPlayer), [a simplistic message board](https://github.com/Wiztim/aws-lambda-forum), and [a refund checker](https://github.com/Wiztim/price-drop-checker). The music player was my first solo project, and was built using C#. The next solo project was a message board using only free tier AWS products. It was meant as a fun way to learn how to use AWS and learn a bit of frontend. Unfortunately, an update to AWS's API service made the forum dysfunctional, and I've mostly fixed the frontpage. The third and incomplete (as of 10/1/22) project is the refund checker. It is a group project of me with 2 others, and I have the role of project lead. It's been a slow burn, and we should hopefully be finished soon.
>Schoolwork

- [x] Highschool coding
- [x] Community College coding
- [x] Lower Division CS
- [ ] Upper Division CS
- [ ] Math-CS Diploma

With the completion of this quarter, I'll only have 3 more CS courses! I don't have too much to say about my my classwork, since the only time I remember being told to make my own project was in high school. Hopefully, all my remaining classes go smoothly as they have in the past.

>Internships and jobs

Absolutely nothing! The best I got was an interview explaining why I wasn't moving on. It was very useful, since I learned I was missing group work from my experiences, which every company <sup>probably</sup> used a reason to not continue with me. This year, I plan to use my personal group project and this class as proof of group work, as well as not applying to the top companies.

>Lab Week 0 & 1

I made 2 silly mistakes in my first try, one at each of the first 2 steps. The first one was forgetting this: 

    remote: Please see https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls for information on currently recommended modes of authentication.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Wiztim/cse-110.git/'
I found this change pretty obnoxious, but it isn't too bad that I'll go out of my way to remove/fix this. As for the 2nd mistake, can you guess what it is? ![oops](/pictures/CSE110Lab0p2bad.png) The answer: I spelled "PRIVTE.txt".
And this is it for the first lab! Hope you learned some stuff about me, and I hope I fulfilled the markdown usage.
